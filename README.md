## Background

I was doing Strength & Conditioning training very often through the pandemic when I had a coach conduct live classes. On some days I would experiment with a subscription service Cult.Fit to try out something interesting. 

However, this changed when I started Triathlon training with a remote coach. I was supposed to do specific exercises, all on my on. I wasn't able to sustain it.
